## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### What I learned

I used this project to learn more about [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) as someone with a [React](https://react.dev/learn) background. It was very insightful and fun. I used the Options API particulary because that's what I use currently at my day Job. More than anything, it really helped me understand the hype around
the composition API; for composability, the composition API really shines through. I'm pretty sure I'll be using the composition API going forward. 

By default, I use [Next js](https://nextjs.org/docs) for new projects and for the past year or so, I've been exploring things I can possibly do with it; one of those things is to use it as backend. I follow Theo on youtube and I remember him saying [this same exact thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB5Fh46Vi4) and I wanted to test it out. 
Considering the relative small scope of this project, [Next js](https://nextjs.org/docs) turned out to be fantastic to use as backend. Essentially, I used it to build my API endpoints.

I used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) as my ORM for database querying; I really like their new AI chat assistant because it helped a ton with several questions I had regarding various query operations and their intricacies.

This project also enabled me to see how flawed the application code can be when written purely with Javascript. I had to debug and refactor quite a bit of code because Javascript couldn't catch errors on the fly. I will be using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for sure to build my future projects.

[Cody AI](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) proved to be a wonderful AI companion. For quick look ups and hints, it helped me avoid spending hours searching the internet for a suitable answer. I used the Pro version which is free until February 14th,2024 and it's just great. The power of AI in web development is undeniable!
